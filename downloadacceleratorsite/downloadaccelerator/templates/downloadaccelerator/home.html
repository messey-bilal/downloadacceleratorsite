          <h2>Powerful download software</h2>
          <p>
            Our software uses unique algorithms to receive Internet data in a fastest possible way.
                  Download Accelerator will accelerate downloads all times because of its innovative dynamic file
                  segmentation technology. Unlike other download managers and accelerators, Download Accelerator threads
                  downloaded files dynamically during download process, and it reuses available connections without additional connect
                  and login stages to achieve the best possible acceleration performance.
